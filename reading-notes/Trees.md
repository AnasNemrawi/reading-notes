# Trees


i read about  trees, specifically binary trees, binary search trees, and k-ary trees. and learned some common terminology associated with trees, such as nodes, root, left child, right child, edge, leaf, and height.
explored two categories of tree traversals: depth-first and breadth-first. Depth-first traversal involves prioritizing the depth (height) of the tree first and has three methods: pre-order, in-order, and post-order. Pre-order visits the root first, then the left child, and finally the right child. In-order visits the left child, then the root, and finally the right child. Post-order visits the left child, then the right child, and finally the root.
