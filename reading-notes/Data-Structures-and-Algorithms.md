# ***Data Structures and Algorithms***

>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental principles in computer science. They provide a way to organize and store data efficiently, and algorithms help in solving problems and manipulating that data.

## ***What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?***

> It depends on the purpose you need it for because each data structure have its  advantage and disadvantage

## ***How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?***

> by use Base Cases

## ***Things I want to know more about***

>I'd like to know more about DSA
