## Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a system that manages network or system access based on individuals' roles within an organization. It ensures users only have access to resources necessary for their job roles, enhancing security and simplifying access management.

2. Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

- Administrator: Full access (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to all resources.
- Manager: CRUD access to department-specific data.
- Employee: Read access to their data, with limited update rights.
- Guest: Read-only access to public information.

3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?

- Access Control: RBAC offers a structured approach to access control, ensuring that users only have access to resources pertinent to their roles.

- Simplicity: RBAC streamlines access permission management by grouping users into roles. This simplifies the assignment and revocation of access as user roles evolve.
