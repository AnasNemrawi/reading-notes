# Graphs

> we can use graphs in real-world applications, such as GPS and mapping systems. Imagine you're using a GPS navigation app to find the fastest route to your destination. Under the hood, the app uses graph theory to analyze the road network. Each road intersection or junction becomes a node, and the roads between them become edges. The app then applies algorithms to find the shortest path from your current location to your destination by traversing this graph.
