#Linked Lists
>1. A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other and each node points to the next node in the list.
>2. each node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.
>3. linked lists are linear data structures and they have a specific sequence and order in their construction. non-linear data structures do not require items to be arranged in order, allowing for non-sequential traversal.
#bigO
>Big O is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function and it depends on 2 factors running time and memory space to analyse these factors we use 4 things 
>1. Input Size
>2. Units of Measurement
>3. Orders of Growth
>4. Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case
